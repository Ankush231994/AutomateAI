Accenture and Schaeffler are testing and training robots in digital twins. Physical AI plays a key role in this process: it combines precise physical modeling of the real world with cutting‑edge AI technology. This enables robots to autonomously learn how to navigate their virtual environment and accomplish tasks as efficiently as possible.
