In a proof‑of‑concept (PoC), humanoid robots, such as Agility Robotics’ Digit, perform material handling, such as tote handling and transport to kitting and commissioning areas. The PoC also demonstrates how Sanctuary AI’s multi‑dexterous humanoid robot, Phoenix, learns real‑world tasks in Omniverse by observing simulations. An example is assembling customized spare part kits in a Schaeffler spare parts center. The imitation learning technique is enabled by vision AI applications like NVIDIA Metropolis, which capture movements of humans and humanoid robots in the real world and transfer them into the NVIDIA Omniverse.
