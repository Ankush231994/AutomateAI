History
1883-1939
In 1883, Friedrich Fischer of Schweinfurt designed a machine to allow steel balls to be ground to an absolutely round state for the first time â€“ and in large volumes.
On 29 July 1905, the FAG brand was registered with the patent office in Berlin. The registered trademark FAG is an acronym for "Fischer's Automatische Gussstahlkugelfabrik," or "Fischer's Automatic Steel Ball Factory."
